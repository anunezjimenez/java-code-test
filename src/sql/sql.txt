1.	Create a query to return the unique rows in a table

select distinct * from table_name;


2.	Write a command to insert values into a table

If the table called “customer” has the following columns:

customer_id : number
customer_name : varchar2(100)
telephone : varchar2(10)
city : varchar2(50)

The insert command would be:

insert into customer (customer_id, customer_name, telephone, city)
values (12345, ‘John Smith’, ‘601123456’, ‘Malaga’);


3.	Create a query that joins two tables together. Note, all rows from the first table must be in the result-set (e.g. given customer and order tables, return all customers and any orders for each customer)

Using the above table “customer” and the table “order” defined as follows:

order_id : number
ustomer_id : number (foreign key to customer_id in table “customer”)
order_date : date

The query would be as follows:

select customer.customer_id, customer.customer_name, order.order_id, order.order_date
from customer left join order on customer.customer_id = order.customer_id;
